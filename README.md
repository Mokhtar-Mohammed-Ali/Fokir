# Fokir
 A practice project focused on learning and applying CSS Flexbox to build modern, flexible layouts â€” instead of traditional float and display methods. Part of the Full Stack course at Root Academy, this project is a key step before moving on to media queries and CSS Grid for responsive web design.
